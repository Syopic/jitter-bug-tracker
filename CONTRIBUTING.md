## How to Report Bugs

### Before Submitting a Bug Report

1. **Search existing issues** - Check if the bug has already been reported
2. **Update your game** - Make sure you're running the latest version of Jitter
3. **Gather information** - Collect relevant details about your system and the issue

### Submitting a Bug Report

#### What Makes a Good Bug Report?

A good bug report includes:
